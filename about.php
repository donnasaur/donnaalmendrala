            <p>Donna received her Master of Fine Arts degree from the Center for Cartoon Studies in Spring 2012 and now resides in the Bay Area, California. In addition to cartooning, she studied illustration, design, and web and print production. She comes from a science background working as a research associate with a Bachelor of Science in Chemical Biology from the University of California, Berkeley (2008). She loves drawing, reading, and writing cartoons, and she dreams about it when she sleeps.</p>
						<p>She likes tech and spends a lot of her free time learning programming languages so she can make comics about them. She is also an avid player of boardgames.</p>
