			<p class="aboutText">Until further notice, Donna Almendrala is pursuing her love of comics as a Master of Fine Arts candidate (2012) at the Center for Cartoon Studies. In addition to cartooning, she studies illustration, design, and web and print production. She comes from a science background working as a research associate with a Bachelor of Science in Chemical Biology from the University of California, Berkeley (2008). She loves drawing, reading, and writing cartoons, and she dreams about it when she sleeps.</p>
			<p class="aboutText">She likes computers and spends a lot of her free time learning programming languages so she can make comics about them. She is also an avid player of boardgames.</p>
